- 👋 Hi, I’m Vaishnavi Agrawal
- 👀 I’m passionate about turning logic into design—where code meets creativity in Web Development, AI, and user experience.
- 🌱 I’m currently sharpening my skills in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects, full-stack apps, and beginner-friendly AI/ML tools
- 📫 How to reach me agrawalvaishnavi66@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy debugging code more than writing it from scratch... it feels like solving a puzzle!
